# random-word-team-generator
This is a project we used for a design thinking activity as a fun ice breaker game at our events. This project uses Scripting in Google sheets to create random groups of two people with different skill sets and assign them a random keyword that their design and ideas would be based on.

This project is using an API from https://random-word-api.herokuapp.com/ to generate the random words.

For this script, the number of players must be even number.

Developed by our Women Techmaker, Lim Xin Ying.
